# Data Quality Testing Strategy

## 🎯 **Context & Importance**

**Trust and confidence in data is critical** for sales representatives who are the target end user persona for this project's business model. Sales reps put their credibility on the line with prospects based on this intelligence, making data quality validation essential.

## 🚀 **Recent Enhancements**

We've recently implemented several quality improvements:

- ✅ **Comprehensive Google Knowledge Graph extraction** (85% more metadata)
- ✅ **DynamoDB caching** for GoogleKnowledgeGraphService and CompanyEnrichmentService  
- ✅ **Quality score fixes** - Only using real extraction metrics, no guessing
- ✅ **Trust-based confidence scoring** - No fallback values, maintaining data integrity

## 📊 **Quality-Focused Testing Strategy**

### 🔍 **1. Data Accuracy & Completeness**
- **Verify Google Knowledge Graph extraction** - Check if the comprehensive metadata is accurate
- **Test confidence scores** - Ensure they reflect actual data quality, not guesswork
- **Source attribution** - Verify we can trace information back to trusted sources
- **Consistency** - Compare cached vs fresh results for quality maintenance

### 🎯 **2. Sales Rep Use Case Validation**
- **Company enrichment quality** - Is the data actionable for sales prep?
- **Competitor insights** - Are competitor suggestions relevant and accurate?
- **Product recommendations** - Do they align with company profile?
- **Domain suggestions** - Are they realistic and useful?

### ✅ **3. Trust Indicators to Validate**
- **Quality Score accuracy** - Only using real extraction metrics (no guessing)
- **Source reliability** - Google Knowledge Graph vs other sources
- **Cache integrity** - Cached data maintains same quality as fresh
- **Failure handling** - Graceful degradation when data is incomplete

## 🧪 **Testing Plan**
