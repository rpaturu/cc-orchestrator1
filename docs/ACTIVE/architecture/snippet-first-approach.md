# Snippet-First Content Analysis Approach

## Overview

This document describes the **snippet-first approach** implemented in the Sales Intelligence API, inspired by Anthropic's efficient content processing methodology. This approach dramatically improves performance by analyzing search snippets first, then selectively fetching only the most critical full content.

## Problem Statement

### Previous Approach (Inefficient)
```
1. Get search results with snippets
2. Automatically fetch ALL 20 URLs for full content  
3. Feed everything to AI
4. Result: 200+ seconds timeout, high API costs
```

### Anthropic's Approach (Efficient)
```
1. Get search results with snippets
2. Use snippets as primary source (they're often sufficient)
3. Selectively fetch only when snippets lack detail
4. Result: 85% faster, lower costs, better user experience
```

## Implementation Architecture

### 4-Step Decision Logic Flow

#### **STEP 1: Extract Snippets for AI Analysis**
```typescript
// Extract all snippets from search results (30 total)
const snippets = allSearchResults.map(result => ({
  title: result.title,
  snippet: result.snippet,        // The key information
  url: result.url,
  sourceDomain: result.sourceDomain
}));
```

#### **STEP 2: AI Evaluates Snippet Completeness**

**The AI System Prompt Logic:**
```
Your job:
1. Extract all available insights from the provided snippets
2. Identify what critical information is missing for comprehensive overview analysis  
3. Recommend which URLs should be fetched for full content to fill the gaps
4. Provide confidence score for snippet-only analysis
```

**AI Decision Criteria:**
- **High Confidence (80%+)**: Snippets contain sufficient information
- **Medium Confidence (60-79%)**: Some gaps, fetch 1-2 critical URLs
- **Low Confidence (<60%)**: Significant gaps, fetch 3+ critical URLs

#### **STEP 3: Selective Content Fetching**

**Decision Algorithm:**
```typescript
// Only fetch if confidence is below threshold OR critical gaps exist
if (snippetAnalysis.confidence < 75 || snippetAnalysis.missingInfo.length > 2) {
  // Sort by priority and fetch top 2-3 URLs
  const criticalUrls = snippetAnalysis.criticalUrls
    .sort((a, b) => b.priority - a.priority)
    .slice(0, 3);
  
  // Selective fetch (not all 20 URLs)
  const additionalContent = await this.contentFetcher.fetchBatch(
    criticalUrls.map(item => item.url)
  );
}
```

#### **STEP 4: Intelligent Content Combination**

**Merge Strategy:**
```typescript
// Combine snippet insights with selective full content
const finalAnalysis = await this.aiAnalyzer.combineSnippetAndContentInsights(
  snippetAnalysis.snippetInsights,
  additionalContent,
  companyName
);
```

## AI Prompt Engineering

### Snippet Analysis System Prompt
```
You are an expert business analyst specializing in company research. 

Analyze the provided search snippets and extract comprehensive company insights.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. Extract ALL available information from snippets
2. Identify what key information is missing for a complete company overview
3. Recommend specific URLs to fetch for missing details
4. Provide confidence score (0-100) for snippet-only analysis

OVERVIEW ANALYSIS AREAS:
- Company basics (name, industry, founding, size)
- Business model and revenue streams  
- Financial performance and metrics
- Leadership and key personnel
- Recent news and developments
- Market position and competitors
- Technology stack and capabilities
- Challenges and opportunities

OUTPUT FORMAT:
{
  "snippetInsights": { ... comprehensive analysis ... },
  "missingInfo": ["specific gaps array"],
  "criticalUrls": [
    {
      "url": "...",
      "reason": "why this URL is needed",
      "priority": 1-10
    }
  ],
  "confidence": 85
}
```

### Content Combination System Prompt
```
You are combining insights from search snippets with additional fetched content.

TASK:
1. Take the snippet-based analysis as the foundation
2. Enhance it with insights from the additional fetched content
3. Resolve any conflicts or contradictions
4. Provide a unified, comprehensive analysis

GUIDELINES:
- Prioritize recent information over older data
- Cross-reference claims between sources
- Highlight high-confidence vs. uncertain information
- Maintain consistent formatting and structure
```

## Performance Benefits

### Speed Improvements
- **Before**: 20 URLs × 10 seconds = 200+ seconds (timeouts)
- **After**: 2-3 URLs × 10 seconds = 20-30 seconds ✅
- **Improvement**: ~85% faster execution

### Cost Reduction
- **ContentFetcher API calls**: 85% reduction
- **Processing time**: Shorter Lambda execution
- **Google Search API**: Same usage (only fetching is optimized)

### Quality Improvements
- **Intelligent selection**: AI picks most valuable URLs
- **Rich snippets**: Often contain 70-80% of needed information
- **Focused analysis**: Better insights from targeted content

```
Input: Limited snippets, mostly old information
Confidence: 45%  
Missing: ["current business model", "recent leadership", "financial metrics"]
Action: Fetch 3 critical URLs (company site, recent news, financial reports)
Result: Comprehensive overview in 35 seconds
```

## Configuration

### Confidence Thresholds
```typescript
const CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLDS = {
  HIGH: 80,     // Snippet-only analysis
