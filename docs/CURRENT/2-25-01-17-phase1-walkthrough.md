Perfect! Let me explain exactly what we're implementing in Phase 1 based on the implementation guide and our frontend-first approach.

## 🎯 Phase 1 Implementation Overview
What We're Building: Customer-Driven Guided Intelligence
Instead of the current batch-mode experience, we're creating a conversational research workflow that guides users through contextually relevant questions based on their profile and the customer they're researching.

🔄 The Complete Phase 1 Flow
## Step 1: Clean Slate Frontend Architecture

**What we're doing:**
- Archive the legacy EnhancedIntelligenceExperience.tsx and HybridIntelligenceExperience.tsx files
- Create a new /research route with a clean, guided experience
- Build reusable components that follow shadcn patterns

## Step 2: Customer Search & Selection

**What we're implementing:**
- Company search input with real-time autocomplete
- Display search results with key context (industry, size, location)
- User selects company → triggers context loading
- Clean transition to guided research mode
**UX Goal: Similar to the vendor selection in onboarding - simple, fast, clear**

## Step 3: Basic Customer Context Collection

**What we're building:**
- Lightweight API call to gather basic company details
- Display customer context card with key info
- Show recent news, industry, size, basic tech stack (if cached)
- < 3 second target for this context establishment
**Purpose: Give user and system enough context to generate relevant guided questions**

## Step 4: Profile-Driven Question Generation

**What we're implementing:**

- Question engine that considers:
  - User's role (AE vs CSM vs SE)
  - User's company (Okta vs Salesforce, etc.)
  - Customer context (FinTech vs Healthcare, etc.)
- Display 4-5 highly relevant guided questions as buttons
- Questions are different based on who's asking and who they're researching

**Key Innovation: Same customer, different user = completely different questions**

## Step 5: SSE-Powered Interactive Responses

**What we're building:**
- User clicks question → opens SSE stream
- Real-time progress updates ("🔍 Analyzing identity infrastructure...")
- Streaming response with vendor-specific insights
- Follow-up questions appear based on discovered data
- Clean, chat-like interface with sources

## 🏗️ Technical Components We're Implementing

**Frontend Components (shadcn-based)**
1. GuidedResearchPage - Main container component
2. CustomerSearchInput - Company search with autocomplete
3. CustomerContextCard - Displays selected company info
4. GuidedQuestionPanel - Shows context-aware question buttons
5. ChatInterface - SSE-powered streaming responses
6. useGuidedChat - React hook for SSE management

**Backend Services (Lightweight)**
1. /api/company-search - Company autocomplete endpoint
2. /api/customer-context - Basic company details collection
3. /api/guided-questions - Generate questions based on user + customer context
4. /api/guided-chat/stream - SSE endpoint for interactive responses

**Integration Points**
1. User Context: Leverage existing ProfileContext from cc-intelligence
2. Dataset Collection: Use existing dataset requirements matrix
3. Caching: Integrate with current DynamoDB cache layers

## 🎯 What Makes This Revolutionary ##

**Context Awareness Examples:**

**Scenario A: Sarah (AE at Okta) researching Acme Corp (FinTech)**
- Questions focus on: identity solutions, decision makers, compliance needs
- Responses include: Okta-specific opportunities, competitive positioning vs Azure AD

**Scenario B: Mike (CSM at Okta) researching same Acme Corp**
- Questions focus on: current Okta usage, adoption metrics, expansion opportunities
- Responses include: feature utilization insights, upsell opportunities

**Scenario C: Different company vendor researching Acme Corp**
- Completely different questions and vendor-specific insights

## 📱 Frontend-First Implementation Strategy

**Week 1: Core Frontend Structure ✅ COMPLETED**
1. ✅ Create new /research route and clean page structure
2. ✅ Build customer search component with mock data
3. ✅ Create guided question panel with vendor-aware questions (2-3 per role)
4. ✅ Build basic chat interface layout
5. ✅ Add proper TypeScript interfaces and shadcn-only components
6. ✅ Implement context-aware question generation (AE/CSM/SE roles)
7. ✅ Fix vendor vs customer context understanding

**Frontend Testing Phase 🧪 CURRENT**
- **Status**: Ready for user testing of guided flow
- **Test**: Complete end-to-end user journey (search → context → questions → chat placeholder)
- **Validate**: Vendor-aware question generation, user profile integration, responsive design
- **Decision Point**: Frontend UX validation before backend development

**Week 2: SSE Integration & Backend Connection 🚧 NEXT**
1. ❌ Implement SSE hook for real-time streaming
2. ❌ Connect to backend APIs (starting with mocked responses)
3. ✅ Add context-aware question generation (frontend complete)
4. ✅ Integrate with existing user profile system

**Why Frontend-First Works:**
- Rapid prototyping: See the UX immediately
- Clear backend requirements: Frontend tells us exactly what APIs we need
- User validation: Test the guided experience before building complex backend
- Incremental integration: Connect to existing backend services step by step


## 🎪 Demo Flow We're Building

1. User clicks "Research Company" 
2. Types "Acme Corp" → sees autocomplete suggestions
3. Selects company → basic context loads in 2-3 seconds
4. System shows: "You're an Okta AE researching a FinTech company. Here are key areas to explore:"
5. User sees 2-3 relevant questions specific to their situation
6. Clicks question → real-time streaming response with Okta-specific insights
7. Follow-up questions appear → user continues guided discovery

**Result: Instead of overwhelming data dumps, users get intelligent, contextual guidance through relevant research.**

This approach gives us a working, demonstrable experience that showcases the guided intelligence concept while building toward the full SSE + dataset collection backend integration.

## 🧪 **Frontend Testing Strategy - REQUIRED BEFORE BACKEND**

### **Why Test Frontend First:**
- **Validate UX Flow**: Ensure guided experience is intuitive and valuable
- **Catch Frontend Issues**: Fix UI/interaction problems before backend complexity
- **Confirm Requirements**: Frontend testing reveals exact backend API requirements
- **User Validation**: Get feedback on guided intelligence concept early

### **Testing Checklist:**

**1. User Profile Integration ✅**
- [ ] User profile loads correctly in header
- [ ] Role-based questions appear (AE vs CSM vs SE)
- [ ] Vendor context displays properly (company name, role)

**2. Guided Flow End-to-End ✅**
- [ ] Company search shows demo companies
- [ ] Company selection transitions to context step
- [ ] Context step shows customer details with vendor-aware messaging
- [ ] Questions step shows 2-3 role-appropriate questions
- [ ] Chat step shows SSE placeholder with vendor-specific messaging

**3. Context Awareness ✅**
- [ ] AE sees identity/decision-maker focused questions
- [ ] CSM sees usage/expansion focused questions  
- [ ] SE sees integration/technical focused questions
- [ ] All messaging reflects vendor → customer research context

**4. Responsive Design ✅**
- [ ] Works on mobile/tablet/desktop
- [ ] Shadcn components render properly
- [ ] Navigation flows smoothly

**5. Error States ✅**
- [ ] Handles missing user profile gracefully
- [ ] Shows appropriate loading states
- [ ] No console errors or TypeScript issues

### **Testing Commands:**
```bash
# Start frontend
cd cc-intelligence
npm run dev

# Test at: http://localhost:5173/research
# Verify: User profile integration, guided flow, context awareness
```

### **Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Complete guided flow works without errors
- ✅ Questions are contextually relevant to user role
- ✅ Vendor vs customer context is clear throughout
- ✅ Ready for backend SSE integration

**Decision Point**: Once frontend testing validates the guided experience, proceed with SSE backend implementation.
