## Overview

The Sales Intelligence API provides three distinct search modes to gather company intelligence, each optimized for different use cases and contexts. All modes use a strategic 3-query approach inspired by Perplexity's methodology to maximize information quality while respecting API quota limits.

## Mode 1: Generic Mode (Default)

### Description
Basic company overview search without seller context. Uses general research queries to gather comprehensive company information.

### Usage
```
GET /search?target=shopify.com
```

### Query Strategy
When no seller company is provided, the system generates 3 generic research queries:
1. `"[Company] company overview 2024"`
2. `"[Company] business model revenue"`
3. `"[Company] news challenges opportunities"`

### Example Request
```bash
curl -X GET "https://your-api-endpoint/search?target=shopify.com"
```

### Response Focus
- General company information
- Business model and revenue details
- Recent news and market position
- Generic challenges and opportunities

---

## Mode 2: Relationship-Aware Mode (Enhanced)

### Description
Contextual search that considers the relationship between seller and target companies. Generates queries focused on partnerships, integrations, and business relationships.

### Usage
```

```

### Parameters
- `target`: Target company domain or name (required)
- `sellerCompany`: Your company name (optional, enables enhanced mode)

- `sellerProducts`: Your products/services (optional)

### Query Strategy
When seller company is provided, generates relationship-focused queries:
1. `"[SellerCompany] [TargetCompany] partnership integration"`
2. `"[TargetCompany] [seller industry] solutions challenges"`
3. `"[TargetCompany] company overview business model"`

### Example Request
```bash

```

## Mode 3: Chat Interface Mode (Dynamic)

### Description
Natural language processing mode that interprets user intent and generates dynamic, context-aware search queries based on conversational input.

### Usage
```
POST /chat
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "message": "Tell me about Shopify's challenges with inventory management",
  "sellerCompany": "Atlassian",
  "context": "previous conversation context"
}
```

### Intent Detection

- **Technology**: Technical stack, integrations, tools
- **Competitive**: Competitors, market position
- **Financial**: Revenue, funding, growth
- **Leadership**: Key personnel, decision makers

2. `"Shopify pain points difficulties"`
3. `"Shopify competitive threats market"`

#### User Input: "How could Atlassian help Shopify with project management?"
Generated Queries:
1. `"Shopify project management challenges"`

  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "message": "I work for Atlassian and want to understand Shopifys development workflow challenges",
    "sellerCompany": "Atlassian",
    "sellerProducts": "Jira, Confluence, Bitbucket"
  }'
```

### Response Focus

## Technical Implementation

### Query Optimization Strategy
All modes follow these principles:
- **3 queries maximum** per request (quota-efficient)
- **Simple, natural language** queries (1-6 words when possible)
- **Trust Google's algorithm** rather than complex operators
- **Sequential execution** with rate limiting (0.5 RPS)

### Rate Limiting
- **0.5 requests per second** to Google Custom Search API
- **Sequential query execution** to prevent 429 errors
- **Built-in delays** between requests

### Content Processing
1. **Search Execution**: 3 strategic queries per mode
2. **Content Fetching**: Top 2 results per query (up to 6 URLs)
3. **AI Analysis**: Claude analysis for intelligence extraction
4. **Response Formatting**: Structured JSON with insights

### Error Handling
- **Quota management**: Efficient 3-query approach
- **Rate limit compliance**: Sequential execution with delays
- **Graceful degradation**: Fallback to available results
- **Comprehensive logging**: Detailed timing and error tracking

## API Response Format

All modes return a consistent response structure:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "companyOverview": {
      "name": "Shopify Inc.",
      "domain": "shopify.com",
      "description": "...",
      "keyMetrics": {...},
      "recentNews": [...],
      "challenges": [...],
      "opportunities": [...]

      "mode": "relationship-aware|generic|chat",
      "queriesUsed": ["query1", "query2", "query3"],
      "totalResults": 15,
      "processingTime": "8.2s"
    }
