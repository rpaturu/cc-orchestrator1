# My Search and Response Process

---

**1. Decision to Search**
- I first evaluate whether I need to search at all.
- I search when:
  - The topic involves rapidly changing information (like current best practices, recent trends)
  - You specifically want current/recent information
  - My knowledge might be outdated for the specific context

*Example:* For your sales preparation question, I searched because sales methodologies and tools evolve quickly, and you'd benefit from current best practices.

**2. Strategic Search Queries**
- I craft focused, specific search queries rather than broad ones:
  - "sales account manager customer session preparation 2024"
  - "tech sales customer meeting preparation competitive analysis 2024"
- I keep queries concise (1â€“6 words typically work best) and include relevant years when seeking current information.

**3. Information Processing**
- When I get search results, I:
  - **Scan for relevance:** Identify which results actually address your question
  - **Extract key insights:** Pull out specific, actionable information that adds value
  - **Note authoritative sources:** Prioritize insights from credible, recent sources
  - **Identify gaps:** See what's missing that I should cover from my existing knowledge

---

**4. Integration and Response**
- I then combine the search findings with my existing knowledge to:
  - **Synthesize:** Blend new insights with established frameworks I already know
  - **Contextualize:** Apply the information specifically to your situation
  - **Structure:** Organize everything into a logical, actionable format
  - **Cite appropriately:** Reference specific claims that came from search results
