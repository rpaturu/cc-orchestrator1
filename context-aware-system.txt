New Context-Aware System (Current & Future):
✅ /vendor/context - Deep vendor profiling with products, positioning, competitors
✅ /customer/intelligence - Context-aware prospect analysis using vendor knowledge
✅ Step Functions workflow - Better async processing with real-time status
✅ Multi-source orchestration - Intelligent data collection with cost optimization
Core Endpoints That Will Remain:
✅ Health Check (always needed)
✅ Company Overview (foundational company data)
✅ Company Search by Name (basic company lookup)
The Evolution:
Before: Generic company analysis → manual interpretation
After: Vendor context → contextualized customer intelligence → actionable sales guidance
Once fully migrated, the test menu could be as simple as:
Health Check
Company Overview
Company Search by Name
Vendor Context Analysis
Customer Intelligence (Context-Aware)
Complete Sales Workflow Demo
This would be much cleaner and focused on the value-add features rather than low-level data collection endpoints.
